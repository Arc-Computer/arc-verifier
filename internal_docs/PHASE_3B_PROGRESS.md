# Phase 3B Progress Tracker

## Week 1: Real Data Integration âœ…

### Completed (Day 1)
- [x] Created `data_fetcher.py` module with:
  - `BinanceDataFetcher`: Downloads historical klines from Binance public data
  - `MarketDataManager`: Coordinates data fetching for multiple symbols
- [x] Implemented efficient caching to avoid re-downloading
- [x] Added support for:
  - Daily and monthly data files
  - Multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
  - Automatic date range handling
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite
- [x] Verified with real Binance data download

### Test Results
```bash
# Successfully downloaded and parsed:
- BTCUSDT: Dec 1-7, 2024 (145 hourly candles)
- ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT: Multiple symbols working
- Different market regimes tested
```

### Completed (Day 2)
- [x] Enhanced data fetcher with file-based caching system
- [x] Created `DataRegistry` for tracking available data
- [x] Added Parquet caching for 5-10x faster loading
- [x] Created pre-defined regime windows with known market conditions
- [x] Built download helper script (`scripts/download_market_data.py`)
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation (`market_data/README.md`)

### Benefits of File-Based Approach
- Zero database dependencies
- Works immediately after `git clone`
- Users can inspect/audit data directly
- Easy distribution and CDN hosting
- ~20MB for typical testing dataset

### Next Steps (Day 3)
- [ ] Add Coinbase API integration as backup source
- [ ] Download full regime datasets for testing
- [ ] Add checksum verification for data integrity

## Week 2: Strategy Verification Logic (Upcoming)
- [ ] Create `strategy_verifier.py` module
- [ ] Implement arbitrage detection algorithm
- [ ] Implement market making detection
- [ ] Add momentum/trend following detection
- [ ] Create verification metrics and scoring

## Week 3: Fort Score Integration (Upcoming)
- [ ] Update scoring system with performance component
- [ ] Create performance report visualization
- [ ] Integration testing with full pipeline
- [ ] Documentation and examples

## Architecture Notes

The data fetcher integrates cleanly with our existing architecture:
- Uses Docker containers for agent execution (as requested)
- Follows existing patterns (Console output, error handling)
- Minimal dependencies (just pandas for data handling)
- Ready for strategy verification implementation
