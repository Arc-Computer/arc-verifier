# Phase 3: Agent Simulation Engine - Implementation Summary

## What We Built

### 1. Core Simulation Framework (`arc_verifier/simulator.py`)
- **AgentSimulator**: Main orchestration engine that spins up agent containers in isolated environments
- **MockAPIProvider**: Simulates external APIs (Binance, Coinbase, DEXes) with controlled responses
- **BehaviorMonitor**: Tracks agent actions and calculates behavioral scores
- **ScenarioLibrary**: Pre-defined test scenarios for different agent types

### 2. Mock API Server (`arc_verifier/mock_server.py`)
- Full HTTP server that simulates:
  - Price APIs (Binance, Coinbase)
  - DEX APIs (Uniswap, Sushiswap)
  - DeFi protocol APIs (Aave, Compound)
  - Blockchain RPC endpoints
- Supports failure injection (timeouts, invalid data)
- Logs all API calls for behavioral analysis

### 3. CLI Integration
- New `simulate` command: `arc-verifier simulate <image> --scenario <type>`
- Supports price oracle and arbitrage bot scenarios
- Rich terminal output with behavioral scores and anomaly detection

### 4. Behavioral Scoring System
Four key metrics:
- **Correctness**: Does the agent perform expected actions?
- **Safety**: Does it validate inputs and handle errors?
- **Efficiency**: Resource usage and API call optimization
- **Resilience**: Error handling and recovery capabilities

## Key Innovation: Behavioral Verification

Unlike traditional testing that checks if code "works," we verify if agents "behave honestly and safely":

```python
# Example: Arbitrage Bot Verification
scenarios = [
    {
        "name": "profitable_arbitrage",
        "market_data": {
            "eth_price_dex_a": 3000.0,
            "eth_price_dex_b": 3150.0  # 5% spread
        },
        "expected_action": "execute_arbitrage"
    },
    {
        "name": "unprofitable_arbitrage", 
        "market_data": {
            "eth_price_dex_a": 3000.0,
            "eth_price_dex_b": 3003.0  # 0.1% spread (below fees)
        },
        "expected_action": "skip_opportunity"  # Should NOT trade
    }
]
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Build demo oracle agent
cd examples
docker build -f Dockerfile.oracle -t demo-oracle:latest .

# Run simulation
arc-verifier simulate demo-oracle:latest --scenario price_oracle

# Output:
# âœ“ PASSED
# Scenario: normal_price_update
# Behavioral Scores:
#   - Correctness: 0.90 (Excellent)
#   - Safety: 1.00 (Excellent)
#   - Efficiency: 0.85 (Good)
#   - Resilience: 1.00 (Excellent)
```

## What This Solves for NEAR

1. **Trust Verification**: Can verify an agent actually does what it claims before giving it $40k/year
2. **Safety Assurance**: Tests edge cases and failure modes in controlled environment
3. **Behavioral Proof**: Provides evidence that agents behave correctly under various market conditions
4. **No On-Chain Risk**: All testing happens in isolated containers with mock data

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Scenario Library**: Add yield optimizer and market maker scenarios
2. **Multi-Step Scenarios**: Complex market events (flash crashes, liquidity crises)
3. **Performance Metrics**: Integrate with benchmarker for resource usage tracking
4. **CI/CD Examples**: GitHub Actions and GitLab CI integration

## Technical Achievement

We've created a sophisticated behavioral testing framework that:
- Runs agents in production-like TEE environments
- Injects controlled market conditions and failures
- Monitors and scores actual agent behavior
- Provides actionable insights for Fort approval decisions

This is fundamentally different from static analysis or unit tests - we're verifying **runtime behavior** in realistic conditions.
