# Arc-Verifier Updated Roadmap
## From Security Scanner to Performance Verification Platform

### Current Status (Completed)
âœ… **Phase 1: Foundation**
- Docker vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- TEE attestation validation
- Basic performance benchmarking
- Shade agent detection (50+ patterns)
- 0-100 point Fort scoring

âœ… **Phase 2: LLM Intelligence** 
- GPT-4/Claude integration for behavioral analysis
- Intent classification and risk assessment
- Code quality evaluation
- Enhanced Fort scoring (0-180 points)
- Ensemble model evaluation

âœ… **Phase 3A: Behavioral Simulation**
- Agent container orchestration
- Mock API server for controlled testing
- Scenario-based behavioral verification
- Safety and edge case testing

### Immediate Priority: Performance Verification

#### **Phase 3B: Performance Verification Framework** (2-3 weeks)

**Goal**: Verify agent capabilities without predicting returns

**Core Principle**: Simplicity and speed to customer value

**Strategic Alignment**: See [V1_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.md](./V1_DELIVERY_STRATEGY.md) for 80/20 approach and [PHASE_3B_V1_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./PHASE_3B_V1_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed implementation plan

**Deliverables**:

1. **Real Data Integration** (Week 1)
   - Simple Binance CSV data fetcher for historical prices
   - Coinbase API integration as backup source
   - Store 30-day snapshots for 4 market regimes
   - No complex frameworks - just clean data access

2. **Strategy Verification** (Week 2)
   - Enhance existing `backtester.py` with real data
   - Add strategy detection algorithms:
     * Arbitrage: Identify cross-exchange trades
     * Market Making: Detect bid/ask spread capture
     * Momentum: Verify trend-following behavior
   - Focus on "does it do what it claims?" not profits

3. **Comparative Ranking** (Week 3)
   - Percentile-based scoring across agents
   - Risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, drawdown)
   - Consistency scores across regimes
   - Integration with Fort Score (-40 to +80 points)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Keep existing architecture - enhance, don't replace
- Minimal dependencies (just `ccxt` or `requests`)
- No GPU parallelism or complex orchestration
- Focus on verification, not prediction

**Success Metrics**:
- Can verify 100+ agents per day
- Clear pass/fail on strategy claims
- Reproducible rankings
- < 10 minute evaluation time

### Future Phases

#### **Phase 4: Production Readiness** (Month 3)
- CI/CD integration examples
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Customer onboarding tools
- **Audit Trail System** (NEW)
  * Local file storage of all verification runs
  * SHA-256 hashes of replay data
  * Complete trace logs for reproducibility
- **Explainability Reports** (NEW)
  * LLM reasoning in human-readable format
  * Decision tree visualization
  * Score breakdown explanations

#### **Phase 5: Advanced Features** (Post-MVP)
- Multi-agent ecosystem simulation
- Real-time monitoring integration
- Custom strategy templates
- API for third-party integration

### Strategic Pivot

**From**: Trying to predict which agents will be profitable
**To**: Verifying agents do what they claim and ranking them relatively

**Why This Works**:
1. **Achievable**: We can build this in weeks, not months
2. **Valuable**: Solves NEAR's actual problem (agent selection)
3. **Defensible**: Based on verifiable metrics, not predictions
4. **Scalable**: Can evaluate hundreds of agents efficiently

### Success Criteria

1. **Technical**
   - Evaluate 100+ agents per day
   - Consistent, reproducible results
   - < 10 minute evaluation time

2. **Business**
   - NEAR adopts for Fort selection
   - Clear ROI demonstration
   - Path to other protocols

3. **Market**
   - Recognized as verification standard
   - Community adoption
   - Competitive differentiation

### Key Differentiator

While competitors chase the impossible dream of predicting trading profits, Arc-Verifier delivers practical verification of agent capabilities. We answer the question that matters: **"Which agents deserve your trust and capital?"**

### Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Real data integration (Binance CSV + Coinbase API)
2. **Week 2**: Strategy verification algorithms
3. **Week 3**: Comparative ranking + Fort score integration

This positions Arc-Verifier as the essential tool for agent verification - not just for NEAR, but for the entire autonomous agent ecosystem.

### How This Completes Our Value Proposition

**Security + Behavior + Intelligence + Performance = Comprehensive Fort Score (0-180)**

1. **Security** âœ…: Docker scanning, TEE validation (Phase 1)
2. **Behavioral Verification** âœ…: Agent simulation, edge case testing (Phase 3A)
3. **LLM Intelligence** âœ…: GPT-4/Claude analysis, risk assessment (Phase 2)
4. **Performance Verification** ðŸš§: Real backtesting, strategy verification (Phase 3B)

The Performance Verification completes our "simulation" capability by:
- Using **real historical data** instead of synthetic scenarios
- Verifying **actual trading behavior** matches claimed strategies
- Providing **relative rankings** for agent selection
- Integrating seamlessly with our existing scoring system

This pragmatic approach delivers what NEAR needs: **"Which agents deserve your trust and capital?"**
